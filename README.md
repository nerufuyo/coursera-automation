## ⚙️ Configuration

### AI Backend Settings
Edit `ai_backend.py` to configure:

```python
# Enable OpenAI (requires API key)
# openai.api_key = "your-api-key-here"

# Adjust confidence thresholds
MIN_CONFIDENCE = 0.7  # Skip answers below this confidence

# Add custom knowledge patterns
knowledge_patterns = {
    'your_pattern': 'expected_answer',
    # Add more patterns...
}
```

### Extension Settings
Settings are automatically saved:
- Video playback speed preference
- Auto answer enable/disable state
- Backend connection status

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### Extension Not Working
1. **Check permissions**: Extension needs access to coursera.org
2. **Reload extension**: Disable and re-enable in browser settings
3. **Check console**: Open Developer Tools → Console for errors

#### AI Backend Connection Failed
1. **Start backend**: Run `./start_backend.sh`
2. **Check port**: Ensure localhost:8000 is available
3. **Firewall**: Allow Python through firewall if needed

#### Questions Not Detected
1. **Page loading**: Wait for page to fully load
2. **Question format**: Some question types may not be supported
3. **Manual selection**: Use speed controls and manual answer selection

#### Low AI Accuracy
1. **Install better AI**: Add Transformers or OpenAI integration
2. **Check question domain**: AI works best on technical subjects
3. **Review confidence**: Low confidence answers may be incorrect

### Testing & Validation
```bash
# Test AI backend
python advanced_test.py

# Check backend health
curl http://localhost:8000/health

# Restart backend if needed
./start_backend.sh
```

## 🛡️ Safety & Ethics

### Academic Integrity
- **Check institution policies**: Ensure automated tools are allowed
- **Use for learning**: Don't let automation replace actual learning
- **Verify answers**: Always review AI suggestions
- **Original work**: Use for assistance, not replacement

### Privacy & Security
- **Local processing**: Heuristics run entirely locally
- **API usage**: OpenAI integration sends questions to their servers
- **No data storage**: Extension doesn't store personal information
- **Course content**: Questions sent to AI for processing

### Best Practices
1. **Supplement learning**: Use to enhance, not replace study
2. **Understand answers**: Don't just copy AI suggestions
3. **Practice manually**: Try questions yourself first
4. **Respect platform**: Don't abuse Coursera's systems

## 🔄 Updates & Maintenance

### Keeping Current
```bash
# Update Python dependencies
pip install --upgrade -r requirements.txt

# Update AI models (if using Transformers)
pip install --upgrade transformers torch

# Check for extension updates
# Reload extension in browser after updates
```

### Performance Monitoring
- **AI accuracy**: Track how often AI answers correctly
- **Speed performance**: Monitor video playback quality
- **Backend logs**: Check for errors or warnings

    # Your custom AI logic here
    return {
        "answer": selected_answer,
        "confidence": confidence_score,
        "reasoning": explanation,
        "source": "custom_ai"
    }
```

### Extension Customization
Modify the extension behavior:
- **Question detection**: Add new CSS selectors
